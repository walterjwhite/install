    NOTE: arguments are listed in the order they are processed
        -h must be first, program prints help and exits immediately
        -d if enabled, must be listed prior to other options, if listed later, it will be excluded
        -w must be listed after debug

    All configuration items may be configured as such
        _CONF_[APPLICATION_NAME]_[CONFIGURATION_KEY] -> --[application-name]-[configuration-key]= on the command line

        If the current running application is install, and we want to configure the install configuration item, log level, we can simply pass:
            -conf-log-level=0
        
        If the current running application is different than the target application configuration item, then we need to specify it:
            -conf-install_log-level=0

    Please refer to .conf for a complete listing of configuration items for each project.
    All projects inherit from the install configuration.
